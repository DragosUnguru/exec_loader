    The following implementation is my approach for an
executable loader that implements the on-demand paging.

    The on-demand paging is put into practice by handling
page faults via the SIGSEGV signal handler.
    By getting the address that was demanded for a read
or write, we'll get the corresponding memory page.
        -> If it is already mapped, exit with default
            SIGSEGV handler.
        -> If the address is invalid (outside our memory space),
            exit with default SIGSEGV handler.
        -> If this is the first access to the page (minor page fault)
            map the page containing the address that caused the fault
            and copy data from the file exec. file.

    For further implementation details, the code is thoroughly
commented.
